direc.c is the main program. It takes in a file as the first argument
It then goes through the contents of the file
It creates a graph of the size specified by the first integer in the file
It then goes through the file and inserts all the vertices
It then performs a breadth first search for each specified query and prints out directions
The graph is then freed at the end

list.h is the header file for our list ADT. It contains all the function names and parameters

list.c is where our list ADT functions are filled out and given definitions

listDriver.c is the driver program used to test the list ADT functions.
It creates a list and tests the several different functions
It prints what is happening and what the results should be

graph.h is the header file for our graph ADT. It contains all the function names and parameters

graph.c is where our graph ADT functions are filled out and given definitions

graphDriver.c is the driver program used to test the graph ADT functions
It creates a graph and tests the several different functions
It prints what is happening and what the results should be

The Makefile is used to easily compile our main program and driver programs

The README contains the descriptions of each file.
