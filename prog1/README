store.c is the main program. It takes in a file as the first argument. 
It then goes through the contents of the file.
It makes an array of size #ofcustomers+1 and creates a list for each one.
It then goes through the rest of the file adding bookIDs to the lists.
The customer ID is the array index. 
It then prints the formatted list of the customers and their book purchases in sorted order.
The lists are then emptied and freed.


list.h is the header file for our list ADT. It contains all of the function names for our ADT.
It is how our main program accesses the ADT.


list.c is where our list ADT functions are filled out and given definitions.
This is where the list ADT actions occur.


List.DR.c is the driver program used to test the list ADT functions.
It prints everything that should happen and then prints what actually does happen.
It is used to confirm that the functions are working properly.


The Makefile is used to easily compile our main program and driver program


The README contains descriptions of each file
