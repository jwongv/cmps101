bookrec.c is the main program. It takes in a file as the first argument.
It then goes through the contents of the file
It amkes an array of size #ofcustomers+1 and creates a list for each one
It then goes through the rest of the file adding bookIDs to the lists
The customer ID is the array index
A hash is also created to store all the books purchased
Each hash slot has a list of books that were hashed to that slot
Each node in those lists contain the bookID and a list of books its been copurchased with
Each node in that list contains the bookID and the count of copurchases with it
The program then prints recommendations for the highest copurchase if the customer requested it.

list.c is the source file for our book count list
It is the ADT for my list that keeps track of a count variable

List.h is the header file for our book count list.

List.c and list.h were copied over from program 1.

List.DR is our driver program for our list ADT. It tests the list functions

booklist.c is the source file for our book list. This list is put into our hash table

booklist.h is the header file for our book list

booklistDriver.c is the driver program for our booklist ADT. It tests the booklist functions

hash.c is the source file for our hash ADT.

hash.h is the header file for hash.c

hashDriver is the driver program for our hash ADT. It tests the hash functions

The Makefile is used to easily compile our main program and driver programs

The README contains descriptions of each file
